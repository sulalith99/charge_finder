# charge_finder
# for Ag penta nanorod dimer systems # ADF

* charge_finder is a branching script from the autopilot. this will apply different charges for the Ag penta nanorod dimer systems and help to find out what is the most suited charge for the system.

* only deals with a single coordinate file; no alterations to the coordinate files.

* specific locations that needed to be changed are highlighted in the script. mainly you can change the starting to the ending charges, as the script will calculate all the charges that are specified. other than that feel free to change as needed.

* as this is a bash script, use "chmod +x autopilot" to make the script executable and "./autopilot" to run the script.
